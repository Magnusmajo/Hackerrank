"""
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print seven lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.
The fourth line contains the division of the two numbers (first / second).
The fifth line contains the integer division of the two numbers (first // second).
The sixth line contains the modulus of the two numbers (first % second).
The seventh line contains the exponentiation of the two numbers (first ** second).
